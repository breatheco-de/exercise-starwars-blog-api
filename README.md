# StarWars Blog API
<!--endhide--> 

It is recommended to develop this project together with the [StarWars Blog Reading List](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-starwars-blog-reading-list). Eventually, that front-end will integrate with the API you will develop in this project, and you will have a fully functional application with both front-end and back-end.

Today we are going to build an API to manage a blog (The StarWars Blog). Users of this blog will be able to list planets, characters, and add or remove favorites.

To allow users to do all this, we must follow these steps:

1. Start by modeling the database: create a database and the necessary tables to store that information. You may have already done this in the StarWars DataModeling project in [python/flask](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-starwars-data-modeling).
2. Create your endpoints using Flask.
3. Constantly test your endpoints with [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

## üå± How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to use a different template.

We recommend opening the `flask template` using a development environment like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/tutorial-de-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/como-utilizar-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```text
üêç Para Python/Flask:
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/flask-rest-hello

```
> ‚ö† If you work locally, you must have a database and Python 3.7+, but if you use Codespaces or Gitpod, everything is already installed.

The boilerplate has a README file with instructions and a video on how to use it and how to build an API. You can do this interactive tutorial first on [how to build APIs with Flask](https://github.com/breatheco-de/python-flask-api-tutorial).

**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/como-comenzar-un-proyecto-de-codificacion).

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## üìù Instructions

Create an API connected to a database and implement the following endpoints (very similar to SWAPI.dev or SWAPI.tech):

- `[GET] /people` List all `people` records in the database.
- `[GET] /people/<int:people_id>` Show information of a single character by its id.
- `[GET] /planets` List all `planets` records in the database.
- `[GET] /planets/<int:planet_id>` Show information of a single planet by its id.

Additionally, we need to create the following endpoints so that we can have users and favorites in our blog:

- `[GET] /users` List all blog users.
- `[GET] /users/favorites` List all favorites that belong to the current user.
- `[POST] /favorite/planet/<int:planet_id>` Add a new favorite `planet` to the current user with id = `planet_id`.
- `[POST] /favorite/people/<int:people_id>` Add a new favorite `people` to the current user with id = `people_id`.
- `[DELETE] /favorite/planet/<int:planet_id>` Remove a favorite `planet` with id = `planet_id`.
- `[DELETE] /favorite/people/<int:people_id>` Remove a favorite `people` with id = `people_id`.
- Your current API does not have an authentication system (yet), so the only way to create users is directly in the database using the Flask admin.

## üìñ Fundamentals

This exercise will allow you to practice the following skills and concepts:

1. Building APIs using the REST standard (a.k.a: RESTful APIs).
2. Building a database using the **ORM** called [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).
3. Using and understanding database migration systems with [Alembic](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/).

## üòé Feeling confident?

The following requirements are not necessary to complete the project successfully, but you can develop them to continue your learning if you feel confident enough.

`+4` Create endpoints to add (POST), modify (PUT), and delete (DELETE) `planets` and `people`. This way, the entire database can be managed via API instead of relying on the Flask admin.
